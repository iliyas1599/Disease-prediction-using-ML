# Disease-prediction-using-ML
disease predicting web app which using the concept of machine learning makes predictions about various diseases like Malaria, Pneumonia, Diabetes etc.

Down below are the names of the various model files used:
Cancer model = model

Diabetes model = model1

Heart model = model2

Liver model = model4

Kidney model = model3

Malaria model = model111.h5

Pneumonia model = my_model.h5
